How to compile:

javac -cp ./lib/twitter4j-core-4.0.7.jar:. OMHSTwitterAPI.java

java -cp ./lib/twitter4j-core-4.0.7.jar:. OMHSTwitterAPI.java



General Info:
-I have marked the classes which I wrote at the top, the rest were a part of the twitter4j package

-After many hours of working with brenden, the only way I was able to get this program to complie was to 
place the file "twitter4j-core-4.0.7.jar" into a folder called "lib" and compiling it using the commands above

-I have shared the program exactally how it needs to be organized with you on Google Drive
